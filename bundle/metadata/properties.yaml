  # Note(tflannag): We likely don't want to support this going forward as OLM automatically
  # installs the koku-metrics-operator in the same namespace as the curator-operator as
  # OLM's dependency resolution is scoped to namespaces. This is problematic as the
  # koku-metrics-operator doesn't support AllNamespaces OperatorGroup InstallMode, so
  # the rollout of the automatically generated CSV resource fails due to conflicting scoping.
